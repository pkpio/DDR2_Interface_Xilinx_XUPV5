Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   702 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 702
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        138 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      101 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             101
    Number used as Memory:                      37 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:            37
        Number using O6 output only:            37

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   219 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          727
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            25 out of     727    3%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 589 out of     727   81%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         113 out of     727   15%
    Number of unique control sets:               8
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              13 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
