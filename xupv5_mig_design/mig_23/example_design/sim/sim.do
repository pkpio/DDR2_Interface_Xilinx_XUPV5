##Device: Virtex-5
##Purpose:
##    Sample sim .do file to compile and simulate memory interface
##    design and run the simulation for specified period of time. Display the
##    waveforms that are listed with "add wave" command.
##    Assumptions:
##      - Simulation takes place in \sim folder of MIG output directory
